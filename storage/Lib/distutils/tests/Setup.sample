r own special index.
+
+Complete control on the index level is allowed. As an example, in the above case, we might want to change from the default 1 shards with 1 replica per index, to 2 shards with 1 replica per index (because this user tweets a lot). Here is how this can be done (the configuration can be in yaml as well):
+
+----
+curl -XPUT http://localhost:9200/another_user?pretty -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
+{
+    "settings" : {
+        "index.number_of_shards" : 2,
+        "index.number_of_replicas" : 1
+    }
+}'
+----
+
+Search (and similar operations) are multi index aware. This means that we can easily search on more than one
+index (twitter user), for example:
+
+----
+curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/kimchy,another_user/_search?pretty=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
+{
+    "query" : {
+        "match_all" : {}
+    }
+}'
+----
+
+Or on all the indices:
+
+----
+curl -XGET 'http://localhost:9200/_search?pretty=true' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '
+{
+    "query" : {
+        "match_all" : {}
+    }
+}'
+----
+
+And the cool part about that? You can easily search on multiple twitter users (indices), with different boost levels per user (index), making social search so much simpler (results from my friends rank higher than results from friends of my friends).
+
+=== Distributed, Highly Available
+
+Let's face it, things will fail....
+
+Elasticsearch is a highly available and distributed search engine. Each index is broken down into shards, and each shard can have one or more replicas. By default, an index is created with 1 shard and 1 replica per shard (1/1). There are many topologies that can be used, including 1/10 (improve search performance), or 20/1 (improve indexing performance, with search executed in a map reduce fashion across shards).
+
+In order to play with the distributed nature of Elasticsearch, simply bring more nodes up and shut down nodes. The system will continue to serve requests (make sure you use the correct http port) with the latest data indexed.
+
+=== Where to go from here?

+We have just covered a very small portion of what Elasticsearch is all about. For more information, please refer to the https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[elastic.co] website. General questions can be asked on the h
