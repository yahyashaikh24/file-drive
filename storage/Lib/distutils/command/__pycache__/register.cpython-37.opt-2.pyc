+THE ECLIPSE FOUNDATION MAKES AVAILABLE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND/OR OTHER MATERIALS FOR OPEN SOURCE 
+PROJECTS (COLLECTIVELY "CONTENT"). USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR 
+THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. BY USING THE CONTENT, YOU AGREE
+THAT YOUR USE OF THE CONTENT IS GOVERNED BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE
+AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT
+AND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF ANY APPLICABLE LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR NOTICES INDICATED OR REFERENCED BELOW, THEN YOU MAY
+NOT USE THE CONTENT.
+
+Applicable Licenses
+
+Unless otherwise indicated, all Content made available by the Eclipse Foundation is provided to you under the terms and 
+conditions of the Eclipse Public License Version 1.0 ("EPL"). A copy of the EPL is provided with this Content and is
+also available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html. For purposes of the EPL, "Program" will mean the Content.
+
+Content includes, but is not limited to, source code, object code, documentation and other files maintained in the 
+Eclipse Foundation source code repository ("Repository") in software modules ("Modules") and made available as
+downloadable archives ("Downloads").
+
+*   Content may be structured and packaged into modules to facilitate delivering, extending, and upgrading the Content. 
+    Typical modules may include plug-ins ("Plug-ins"), plug-in fragments ("Fragments"), and features ("Features").
+*   Each Plug-in or Fragment may be packaged as a sub-directory or JAR (Javaâ„¢ ARchive) in a directory named "plugins".
+*   A Feature is a bundle of one or more Plug-ins and/or Fragments and associated material. Each Feature may be packaged
+    as a sub-directory in a directory named "features". Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may contain a list 
+    of the names and version numbers of the Plug-ins and/or Fragments associated with that Feature.
+*   Features may also include other Features ("Included Features"). Within a Feature, files named "feature.xml" may 
+    contain a list of the names and version numbers of Included Features.
+
+The terms and conditions governing Plug-ins and Fragments should be contained in files named "about.html" ("Abouts"). 
+The terms and conditions governing Features and Included Features should be contained in files named "license.html" 
+("Feature Licenses"). Abouts and Feature Licenses may be located in any directory of a Download or Module including, but
+not limited to the following locations:
+
+*   The top-level (root) directory
+*   Plug-in and Fragment directories
+*   Inside Plug-ins and Fragments packaged as JARs
+*   Sub-directories of the directory named "src" of certain Plug-ins
+*   Feature directories
+
+Note: if a Feature made available by the Eclipse Foundation is installed using the Provisioning Technology (as defined 
+below), you must agree to a license ("Feature Update License") during the installation process. If the Feature contains 
+Included Features, the Feature Update License should either provide you with the terms and conditions governing the 
+Included Features or inform you where you can locate them. Feature Update Licenses may be found in the "license" 
+property of files named "feature.properties" found within a Feature. Such Abouts, Feature Licenses, and Feature Update 
+Licenses contain the terms and conditions (or references to such terms and conditions) that govern your use of the 
+associated Content in that directory.
+
+THE ABOUTS, FEATURE LICENSES, AND FEATURE UPDATE LICENSES MAY REFER TO THE EPL OR OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS, NOTICES OR 
+TERMS AND CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE OTHER LICENSE AGREEMENTS MAY INCLUDE (BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO):
+
+*   Eclipse Distribution License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/licenses/edl-v10.html)
+*   Common Public License Version 1.0 (available at http://www.eclipse.org/legal/cpl-v10.html)
+*   Apache Software License 1.1 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE)
+*   Apache Software License 2.0 (available at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)

+License, or Feature Update License is provided, please contact the Eclipse Foundation to determine what terms and

+
+### Use of Provisioning Technology
+
+The Eclipse Foundation makes available provisioning software, examples of which include, but are not limited to, p2 and 
+the Eclipse Update Manager ("Provisioning Technology") for the purpose of allowing users to install software,
+documentation, information and/or other materials (collectively "Installable Software"). This capability is provided
+with the intent of allowing such users to install, extend and update Eclipse-based products. Information about packaging
+Installable Software is available at http://eclipse.org/equinox/p2/repository_packaging.html ("Specification").
+
+You may use Provisioning Technology to allow other parties to install Installable Software. You shall be responsible for
+enabling the applicable license agreements relating t
